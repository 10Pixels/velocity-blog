    <p>Few things are more important than setting a baseline when it comes to teaching a group of people some specific skill. It&#39;s sounds rather easy, but for someone reaching out to share their knowledge for the first time, it can be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>The rookie instructor usually ends up spending a considerable amount of time going back to fill in gaps of knowledge because they assumed this knowledge was already there. I can tell you based on my experience that this is the biggest time suck you will encounter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to layout some guidelines to help you set that baseline before you start teaching, and make sure it&#39;s rigid.</p>

<h2>Survey The Skill Levels of The Students In The Course</h2>

<p>The first question you will want to answer is <em>Who is the most knowledgeable in the course</em>? This will set your upper limit and is extremely important. I can almost guarantee that this person can and will help you teach. You may end have people that are relearning a skill, and those people are generally very knowledgeable about the content and are a great asset to you. They will usually ask the questions the others are afraid to.</p>

<p>With the upper limit in mind, find out the bottom most student. This is tricky; real tricky. This person will generally feel one of two ways:</p>

<p>1) They don&#39;t know anything about the topic, admit they don&#39;t know anything about the topic, and think that it&#39;s your job to teach them everything.</p>

<p>2) They know a <em>little</em> and think that&#39;s enough to get them <em>most</em> of the way there.</p>

<p>The first style of student is hard to read because if you ask some questions to get a feel for where they are at in their knowledge, they will just fold because they feel it&#39;s <strong>your</strong> job.</p>

<p>The second style of student is just as hard because once you start asking questions directly and poking holes in what they think they know, they tend to get defensive. </p>

<p>However difficult it is, it&#39;s vital to the success of the course.</p>

<h2>Consider Your Goals For The Course</h2>

<p>Before you can assess a baseline you need something to measure against. When I talked about <a href="http://blog.velocityapp.net/2013/10/29/education-independence.html">Education Independence</a>, I talked about developing a learning plan. This is one those situations where that plan proves it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>As you look through your learning plan, you will get a feel for an overall goal. The main thing that a student should walk away from this course knowing how to do. That&#39;s your benchmark. That&#39;s what you need to keep in mind when setting your baseline.</p>

<p>Time for an example.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my experience, a common theme has always been programming logic. This is usually the most important concept I am trying to get across. That is what I want to measure.</p>

<p>I will ask myself <em>how close are these students to understanding what programming logic is and how to use it</em>? This raises more questions. What obstacles may be in their way? Do they have a false sense of what programming logic is? Do they already know what programming logic is?</p>

<p>The questions you ask yourself about what&#39;s stopping you or what&#39;s stopping them from learning this core concept will open a whole list of question you need answered.</p>

<p>It is these that expose the upper and lower limit.</p>

<p>Ask open-ended questions. Promote a safe learning environment (I&#39;ll talk about safe learning environments another time). And get the students involved in answering and asking questions themselves.</p>

<h2>Set The Baseline And Stick To It</h2>

<p>Watch body language. Observe how they react and think about how to answer. The baseline will appear. Almost like magic.</p>

<p>You are not doing anyone any favors by setting a movable baseline.</p>
