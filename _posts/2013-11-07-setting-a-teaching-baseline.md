title: Setting A Teaching Baseline

Few things are more important than setting a baseline when it comes to teaching a group of people some specific skill. It's sounds rather easy, but for someone reaching out to share their knowledge for the first time, it can be extremely difficult.

The rookie instructor usually ends up spending a considerable amount of time going back to fill in gaps of knowledge because they assumed this knowledge was already there. I can tell you based on my experience that this is the biggest time suck you will encounter.

I'm going to layout some guidelines to help you set that baseline before you start teaching, and make sure it's rigid.

## Survey The Skill Levels of The Students In The Course

The first question you will want to answer is *Who is the most knowledgeable in the course*? This will set your upper limit and is extremely important. I can almost guarantee that this person can and will help you teach. You may end have people that are relearning a skill, and those people are generally very knowledgeable about the content and are a great asset to you. They will usually ask the questions the others are afraid to.

With the upper limit in mind, find out the bottom most student. This is tricky; real tricky. This person will generally feel one of two ways:

1) They don't know anything about the topic, admit they don't know anything about the topic, and think that it's your job to teach them everything.

2) They know a *little* and think that's enough to get them *most* of the way there.

The first style of student is hard to read because if you ask some questions to get a feel for where they are at in their knowledge, they will just fold because they feel it's **your** job.

The second style of student is just as hard because once you start asking questions directly and poking holes in what they think they know, they tend to get defensive. 

However difficult it is, it's vital to the success of the course.


## Consider Your Goals For The Course

Before you can assess a baseline you need something to measure against. When I talked about [Education Independence](http://blog.velocityapp.net/2013/10/29/education-independence.html), I talked about developing a learning plan. This is one those situations where that plan proves it's worth.

As you look through your learning plan, you will get a feel for an overall goal. The main thing that a student should walk away from this course knowing how to do. That's your benchmark. That's what you need to keep in mind when setting your baseline.

Time for an example.

Reflecting on my experience, a common theme has always been programming logic. This is usually the most important concept I am trying to get across. That is what I want to measure.

I will ask myself *how close are these students to understanding what programming logic is and how to use it*? This raises more questions. What obstacles may be in their way? Do they have a false sense of what programming logic is? Do they already know what programming logic is?

The questions you ask yourself about what's stopping you or what's stopping them from learning this core concept will open a whole list of question you need answered.

It is these that expose the upper and lower limit.

Ask open-ended questions. Promote a safe learning environment (I'll talk about safe learning environments another time). And get the students involved in answering and asking questions themselves.


## Set The Baseline And Stick To It

Watch body language. Observe how they react and think about how to answer. The baseline will appear. Almost like magic.

You are not doing anyone any favors by setting a movable baseline.
